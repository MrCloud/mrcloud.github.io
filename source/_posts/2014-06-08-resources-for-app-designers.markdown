I've been developing mobile apps for years now, many times I teamed up with
various people to deliver a new product and most of the time a designer is
involved.

So I've had the fortune to encounter various designer profiles, from web
designers willing to take on the mobile market, to real UI/UX people with great
mindset and knowledge of the specificity of mobile application User Experience.

Unfortunately I also had to work with some designer that do not have any idea of
what mobile application User Experience is/should be. And who would just design
like they would do for a website or just think that design is just a façade
without any other particular role than being beautiful and polished. They are
all wrong. Here's why:

Mobile App design is not like website design, it does require knowledge of the
particularities of mobile platforms and moreover of which platform you're
designing for. Users of each platforms (iOS & Android) have different way to
perform the same actions. And you have to care about it.

Your design does serve a particular role in the App, the design is here to
provide visual representation of a functionality of your app so the user can
understand visually what he can do. Design is meant to be intuitive and to help
the user get the job done.

I've also seen many designer just applying design on mockups and just not going
any further. Great design is no just beautiful "static" interface. Animations
are a key thing, not just to make your app more lively. But it does also serve a
role into giving the user some context & focus.

Be aware of existing patterns, successful apps & controls, develop taste and
criticism and confront opinions on your and other people work.

Try to stay up to date with trends in mobile UI/UX looking for new apps
featured on the app stores, and great designs reviewed by critics.
Know what already exists and is available to developers, many developers have
taste for great design, most of them have some knowledge of platform specific
design and what are the Dos and the Don'ts (Ask them they won't bite !) and they
create and reproduce great controls available online, be aware of that all these
resources exist !

Here are some resources that designers should be aware of when it comes to
designing apps for Apple platforms:

I am aware that many of the links shared here are only available to registered
apple developers, if you're a designer working with iOS/OS X developers, I
encourage you to ask them to add you to the developer team account, so you can
have a look at all the resources provided to you.
